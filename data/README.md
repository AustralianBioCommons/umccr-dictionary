# Note on Simulated Data

This data folder contain simulated data i.e., mock data content.

Each Data Dictionary sub-folder marked `.autogenerated` file and ignored all auto-simulated data files (`*.json`, `*.txt`, etc) for GitHub. i.e., Only for your local computer.

You may submit these simulated data to a Gen3 site by following `DataImportOrder.txt` to import each metadata node defined by the respective Data Dictionary.

> NOTE: Data Dictionary **version** must match, in order to do so!
