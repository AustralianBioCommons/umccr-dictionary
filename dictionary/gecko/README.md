# GECKO Dictionary

An attempt to make a gen3 dictionary from the [GECKO](https://www.cineca-project.eu/blog-all/cohort-minimal-metadata-model-d31?rq=GECKO) data model that was produced by the [CINECA](https://www.cineca-project.eu/) project.

The aim is to be able to host [CINECA synthetic data](https://www.cineca-project.eu/cineca-synthetic-datasets) as a proof of concept.

Currently a copy of the gdc dictionary in order to follow correct layout.
